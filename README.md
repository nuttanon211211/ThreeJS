Multiple Particles Physics in Three.js | Realtime Computer Graphics Physics Simulation 2020/2


  This project is about implementing Three.js to simulate particles in 2D with various physics properties. To visualize particles in 2D with many properties to see witch one is beautiful to the eyes and can be looked for hours and hours, also can be played with particles too like some sort of relaxing game. 
	This project consist of seven html files with script containing three.js. These files are,  new_particle1P.html, particle1.html, particle1P.html, particle2.html, particle3.html, particle4.html, and particle5.html .
  
  This project is the implementation of which is a modified version from the source code.
